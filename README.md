# hello-world!

    I am a student from Shannxi University of Secience & Technology , I prefer program, and I wanna to be somebody on this way. I am fighting from dayon and daynight. Cause I know the best will here for me.Now I'm Senior Two, I have programming for the whole year. Though it seem that I have not a talent for it. Maybe just I am kind of lazy, and not smart. I know not everyone have a good start, but I mean to hace a better end. I determine the way which I choosed is charming. But the teachers of school are just so-so.And I take part in a training agence at the begining of my college.
   All in all, I will go on my way.
